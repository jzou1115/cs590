<h1> CETrFile </h1>

<h2 align="justify">CETrFile trains an energy estimator using the
cluster expansion method starting from both&nbsp; a design file and a
sequence file that includes associated energies (or other
sequence-related property). To remove parts of sequence space not well
described by the CE method, such sequence groups may be identified and
eliminated based on their having cluster functions with large
normalized heterogeneity ratios (NH-ratio). </h2>

<h2 class="nolinespace"><span style="font-style: italic;">Usage</span>
: CETrFile [OPTIONS]</h2>

<h3> <i>ex</i>) <br>
CETrFile -d design.file -s sequence.file -r training.result <br>
CETrFile -d design file -s sequence.file -r training.result -n 3000 -b
5 -l output.file </h3>

<h2 class="nolinespace"> REQUIRED OPTIONS </h2>

<ul>

  <li><i>-d [design file]</i> : design file containing design
information (number of design sites and list for possible amino acids
at each site) and structural information (clusters) </li>
  <li><i>-s [sequence file]</i> : training set containing sequences and
their associated energies</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="nolinespace"> OTHER OPTIONS </h2>

<ul>

  <li><i>-r [training result]</i> : binary results file containing
energy estimator trained using CE method (default file name:
trainresults.eci)</li>
  <li><i>-l [output file]</i> : log file containing various information
generated during training process. If this option is omitted then the
log results print on standard output device.</li>
  <li><i>-n [number of sequences]</i> : number of sequences from
training set to use, starting from beginning of sequence file (default
: number of sequences in sequence file) </li>
  <li><i>-b [d parameter]</i> : a parameter to adjust the stringency of
CF selection. Increasing the value of this option lowers the acceptance
ratio for selecting new CFs, so that the total number of selected CFs
decreases (default 0.0).</li>
  <li><i>-e [number]</i> : number of sequence groups to be eliminated
by eliminating sequences containing the cluster functions with maximum
NH-ratio (default 0) </li>
  <li><i> -m [number]</i> : minimum number of sequences for a CF. If a
training set does not contain this number of sequences for a given CF,
then the CF and its associated sequences are excluded from being
selected. This value must be 3 or larger.</li>
  <li><i> -t [mode]</i> : determine how to deal with higher-order
CFs(triplet) <br>
[<i>mode=0</i>]: use all triplets listed in design file<br>
[<i>mode=1</i>]: use all triplets listed in design file and use
triplets made from selected pair CFs. (if all three possible pair CFs
exist between the three sites, include the triplet CF for those three
sites). <br>
  </li>
<li><i> -v</i> : print version information</li>
<li><i> -h</i> : display this help and exit</li>
  <li><i> -h design</i> : display an example design file</li>
  <li><i> -h sequence</i> : display an example sequence file</li>
