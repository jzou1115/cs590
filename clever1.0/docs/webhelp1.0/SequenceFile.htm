<h1>  
Sequence file
</h1>
<h2 align="justify"> Each sequence file lists a set of sequences that
can be used to either train an energy estimator using cluster
expansion, or to test an already trained energy estimator. Sequence
files can be created manually, or by using a design file and the <a href="GenSeq.htm" onmouseover="window.status='insert link description here'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true">
        GenSeq</a> module. To train an energy estimator using CE (with <a href="CETrFile.htm" onmouseover="window.status='insert link description here'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true">
        CETrFile</a>),
the energies of the associated sequences must be calculated beforehand
and placed in the sequence file. To evaluate the energies of new
sequences, input the sequence file to the <a href="CEEnergy.htm" onmouseover="window.status='insert link description here'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true">
	    CEEnergy</a>
module. The sequence file contains a list of {energy, sequence} data. A
line in this file contains a sequence and its corresponding protein
energy (or other sequence-related property). Each line starts with the
protein energy, and then the amino acids at each design site in the
sequence separated by a space character. Number of amino acids and
their order should correspond to the number of design sites and their
order. If the sequence is to be evaluated as part of a test set, set
the energy to 0. For guidelines on training set size versus number of
clustersto be included in training, see Hahn et al. 2010.
