Design file
</h1>
<h2 align="justify"> This file contains information on design-sites and
list of clusters (protein structural information). Design files are
used to generate sequences for training or testing, and for training of
the cluster expansion. Design-sites information starts with the line <b>"#design_start"</b> and ends with <b>"#design_end"</b>.
Between these two reserved strings, design sites should be listed as a
line per site. The line consists of a number, starting from 1 and
increasing by 1 for each additional design site (the program will
ignore the design site numbers what user designate and assign numbers
from 1 with increasing by 1 manner. Thus&nbsp; clusters should be
described through this number rule), followed by a list of amino acids
allowed at the design site (A-Z, capital letters only). Design site
information can also be used to generate a randomtraining set by
independently drawing residues from the allowed residues at each design
site. </h2>

</h3><h2 align="justify">Structural information starts with "#cluster_start"
and ends with"#cluster_end". Structural information is written using
the clusters: point, pair, and higher-order clusters. Here, all point
clusters should be listed, but pair and higher-order clusters can be
selected by a user according to some criteria such as mutual
information between design sites or structural proximity. Following
examples show how to list clusters, the two possible pair clusters, and
the single possible triplet cluster for a protein with threedesign sites.

<h3 style="width: 1108px;">
If there are three design sites then cluster information can be listed as following,<br>&nbsp; #cluster_start<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		   1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		   2 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		   3 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		   2  3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		   1  2  3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 #cluster_end<br>
Where first three lines denote point clusters, next three lines denote pair clusters, and the last line denotes<br>
triplet cluster.

Example 2) design file incorporating symmetry
</h2>
<h3 align="justify">In coiled-coil case, all design sites designated by
the same heptad position can be approximated to have the same molecular
orbital so that those positions generate similar molecular interaction
energy. This structural repeating pattern makes the CE approximation
more efficient. If we just design 'a','d','e', and 'g' positions among
heptad postions then the cluster information of dimeric coiled coils
can be described as,<br>
&nbsp; #cluster_start   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1; 5;  9; 11; 15; 19<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2; 6; 10; 12; 16; 20<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3; 7; 13; 17<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4; 8; 14; 18<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 2; 5  6;  9 10; 11 12; 15 16; 19 20<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 3; 5  7; 11 13; 15 17<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 4; 5  8; 11 14; 15 18<br>
&nbsp; #cluster_end   <br>                                                          
</h3>

<h2 align="justify">If the clusters are related by symmetry and the
user would like the corresponding cluster functions in that symmetry
class to be trained with the same ECI, then those clusters should be
listed on the same line and separated by semicolons. In the dimeric
coiled coil, a basic unit of symmetry is the heptad and in the given
example design file, design site 1 refers to 'a' in heptad 1 and design
site 5 refers to 'a' in the next heptadover. By listing their single clusters as,

<h2 align="justify">the training program will treat these two
clusters separately and define separate cluster functions and ECIs.
However because of the symmetry between design sites 1 and 5, it makes
sense to treat the interactions these clusters make as identical and
this can be enforced by listing these single clusters as,
