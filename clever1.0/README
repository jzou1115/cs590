CLEVER have been developed to carry out cluster expansion method 
for rapid evaluation of protein energy or other sequence-related 
properties. The cluster expansion method was first introduced in the 
paper, Zhou(2005), and used in various papers, 
i.e. Grigoryan(2006,2009), Apgar(2009), and Hahn(2010).
Please, use Hahn(2010) as a reference for this program

INSTALL
  1. type "make", this generates three executable modules, 
     i.e. GenSeqs, CETrFile, and CEEnergy.
  2. copy the modules to the "test" directory and
     try them using the files in the directory.
  3. copy the modules to the excutable directory
Source codes were compiled successfully in the g++3.4.6 version
